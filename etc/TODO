CONSORT TODO
============

1.  TimespanMaker should not consume playing durations which do not appear in
    the output. The talea should always be unbroken as it wraps around unsynced
    voices.

2.  Decide what to do about PitchAgent. Should AlterationAgent and
    RegisterAgent be merged into it?

3.  Implement a PitchCurve-based PitchAgent class.

4.  Extend MutationAgent.rewrite_meter() to allow Meter sequences. It should be
    possible to rewrite the meter(s) of divisions which cross measure
    boundaries.

5.  Meter rewriting should take into account divisions which cross more than
    one meter boundary.
